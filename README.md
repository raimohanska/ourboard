### Board access controls

All boards created using the UI are accessible to anyone with the link.

Boards with restricted access can currently only be created using the POST API (see below).

## Github Issues Integration

1. Create a board and an Area named "new issues" (case insensitive) on the board.
2. Add a webhook to a git repo, namely
    1. Use URL https://www.ourboard.io/api/v1/webhook/github/{board-id}, with board-id from the URL of you board.
    2. Use content type to application/json
    3. Select "Let me select individual events" and pick Issues only.
3. Create a new issue or change labels of an existing issue.
4. You should see new notes appear on your board

## API

For a full list of API endpoints, see https://ourboard.io/api-docs.

All POST and PUT endpoints accept application/json content.

API requests against boards with restricted access require you to supply a board-specific API_TOKEN
as a HTTP header. The token is returned in the response of the POST request used to create the board.
As a result, only boards created using the API can have an API_TOKEN at the moment.

### POST /api/v1/board

Creates a new board. Payload:

```js
{
    "name": "board name as string",
}
```

You can also specify board access policy, including individual users by email and user email domains:

```js
{
    "name": "board name as string",
    "accessPolicy": {
        "allowList": [
            { email: "coolgirl@reaktor.com" },
            { domain: "reaktor.fi" }
        ]
    }
}
```

Response:

```js
{
    "id": "board id",
    "accessToken": "************"
}
```

The `accessToken` returned here is required for further API calls in case you set an access policy. So, make sure to save the token.

### PUT /api/v1/board/:boardId

Changes board name and, optionally, access policy. Payload is similar to the POST request above.

This endpoint always requires the API_TOKEN header.

### POST /api/v1/board/:boardId/item

Creates a new item on given board. If you want to add the item onto a specific area/container element on the board, you can
find the id of the container by inspecting with your browser.

Payload:

```js
{
    "type": "note",
    "text": "text on note",
    "container": "container element text or id",
    "color": "hexadecimal color code"
}
```

### PUT /api/v1/board/:boardId/item/:itemId

Creates a new item on given board or updates an existing one.
If you want to add the item onto a specific area/container element on the board, you can
find the id of the container by inspecting with your browser.

Payload:

```js
{
    "type": "note",
    "text": "text on note",
    "container": "container element text or id",
    "color": "hexadecimal color code",
    "replaceTextIfExists": boolean,      // Override text if item with this id exists. Defaults to false.
    "replaceColorIfExists": boolean,     // Override color if item with this id exists. Defaults to false.
    "replaceContainerIfExists": boolean, // Override container in item with this id exists. Defaults to true.
}
```

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId

Return board current state as JSON.

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId/hierarchy

Return board current state in a hierarchical format (items inside containers)

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId/csv

Return board current state in CSV format, where

-   A container containing only leaf items (note, text) creates a row and each item in that container gets its own column
-   Container name is a column on the left
-   Any wrapping containers also add a column on the left

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId/history

Returns the full history of given board as JSON.

## Google Authentication integration

Google authentication is supported. To enable this feature, you'll need to supply `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` as environment variables. When running locally, you'll need to place these variables in both `frontend/.env` and `backend/.env`.

## Tech stack

-   TypeScript
-   [Harmaja](https://github.com/raimohanska/harmaja) frontend library
-   WebSockets (express-ws / uWebSockets.js both!)
-   Express server
-   Typera for HTTP API
-   Heroku

## Dev

Running locally requires `docker-compose` which is used for starting the local PostgreSQL database. The script below starts the database, but you must make sure you have a working docker setup on your machine, of course.

Running locally:

```
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```

Run end-to end Cypress tests against the server you just started:

-   `yarn test-e2e:dev` to run once
-   `yarn cypress` to open the Cypress UI for repeated test runs

Connect to the local PostgreSQL database

    yarn psql

## Developing with production data

Do not run your local server against the production database, or you'll corrupt production. The server's in memory state will be out of sync with DB and bad things will happen.

Instead, do this.

1. Capture a backup and download it: `heroku pg:backups:capture`, then `heroku pg:backups:download`.
2. Restore the backup to your local database: `pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d postgres://r-board:secret@localhost:13338/r-board latest.dump`
3. Start you local server using `yarn start:dev`

If you need the local state for a given board in localStorage, you can

1. extract the content in the browser devtools, when viewing production site in browser, using `localStorage["board_<boardid>"]`
2. Copy that string to clipboard
3. Run the following in your localhost site console:

    localStorage["board_32de1a50-09a6-4453-9b9e-ed10c56afa99"]=JSON.stringify(
    <paste content here>
    )

Copy the result string, navigate to your localhost site and paste the same value to the same localStorage key. Refresh and enjoy.

## Hosting

You should be able to host your own OurBoard instance pretty easily. Some environment variables to set:

```
DATABASE_URL:          [Postgres database URL]
DOMAIN:                [your domain name]
REDIRECT_URL:          https://www.ourboard.io/
WS_HOST_DEFAULT:       [your domain name]
WS_HOST_LOCAL:         [your domain name]
WS_PROTOCOL:           [wss for secure, ws for non-secure]
```

AWS environment variables, needed for hosting board assets on AWS S3, otherwise hosted in file system.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_ASSETS_BUCKET_URL
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Google Authentication environment variables, needed if you want to enable Google auth.

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
```
